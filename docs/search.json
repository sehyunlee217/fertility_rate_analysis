    "text": "Declining Birth Rates: A Social Challenge for South Korea\nIn fact, the significant decline in birth rates remains as one of the most pressing challenges facing South Korea. A growing population is vital for sustaining economic growth and ensuring future opportunities, especially in a country where the proportion of elderly citizens is rapidly increasing. With the National Pension Fund for South Korea potentially being depleted within the next 30 years, it is imperative for the South Korean government to enact effective policies that encourage higher birth rates and support young families. Such measures are crucial for balancing the demographic scale and securing the nation’s long-term economic stability."

    "text": "South Korea(KOR): Historical Crude Birth Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the initial data visualization of birth rates, clear breakpoints are observed, influenced by government policies. Between 1979 and 1982 (Green), the South Korean government implemented a one-child policy, leading to a sharp decline in birth rates in the following years. However, due to the rapid population decrease, the government reversed this policy beginning in 1990 (Blue), resulting in a slight increase in birth rates for a few years. Despite the changes, the birth rate continued to decline thereafter. The year 2000 (Orange) marks what some refer to as South Korea’s “demographic cliff” (a term popularized by Harry S. Dent), characterized by a rapid decline in the working-age population. This shift is often attributed to changing social norms, where the desire to have larger families has decreased, coupled with the effects of technological modernization."

    "text": "Female Employment, Dual Income, and Paternal Leave in South Korea(KOR) and Japan(JPN)\nThis analysis focuses on female employment rates in both countries, specifically examining women pursuing careers and participating in the workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale employment has risen in both countries, yet Japan’s birth rate decline is slower than Korea’s. While it was assumed that female employment may lead to similar trends, Korea’s birth rate continues to decline more sharply than Japan’s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Japan has much higher paternal leave rates compared to Korea, for both men and women. The availability of paternal leave may support women in continuing their careers while encouraging earlier childbirth. Therefore, policies that support child care and pregnant women could be a key factor. Additionally, Japan’s higher paternal leave rates for men suggest that male involvement in childcare could have an impact in supporting birth rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe availability of child care facilities shows a different trend as well. While government-run facilities have remained relatively unchanged, Japan has introduced new community-based and integrated child care centers, with annual increases as part of its 5-Year Plan to expand child care capacity, started in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea has been expanding government-run child care facilities, but the growth is slow, and privately run centers are declining. Additionally, workplace child care environments have not significantly improved over the past 20 years, resulting in an overall reduction in the total number of facilities.\nObserving these trends, paternal leave proportions and child care availability may help identify ways to improve South Korea’s birth rate. These factors can also be used to forecast future birth rates. Current policy aims to add 500 child care facilities annually. However, as paternal leave legislation is determined by individual companies, we can assume that current leave trends will remain unchanged.\nAfter fitting a multi-linear regression model with these trends, the p-value for the total number of healthcare facilities was not significant at the 95% level. Therefore, the model incorporates only the parental leave rates for both women and men as explanatory variables, along with a trend component. The best-fitted multi-linear regression model, which minimizes the error for rolling forecast origin cross-validation, is as follows.\n\n\nSeries: Total_Fertility_Rate \nModel: TSLM \n\nResiduals:\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

    "text": "Conclusion\nSouth Korea’s declining fertility rate is driven by socio-economic and policy factors, particularly inadequate child care support and lower paternal leave rates. Compared to Japan, there is room for improvement in child care and higher paternal leave rates, as it has slowed its birth rate decline. South Korea continues to struggle. A multi-linear model that fits paternal leaves as an explanatory variable suggests that increasing maternity leave to 84.5% by 2023 could improve South Korea’s fertility rate by 20%, reaching approximately 0.51 by 2030. To reverse the trend, South Korea must prioritize enhanced child support policies, especially around child care and parental leave."
